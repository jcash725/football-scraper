## Key Differences:

### Traditional Model Issues:
- **Over-reliant on rookie boost** (7/10 top picks were rookies)
- **Used 2024 defensive data** instead of current season
- **Ignored volume metrics** completely
- **No red zone opportunity weighting**

### Combined Model Advantages:
- **Volume-first approach** (proven TD predictor)
- **Current 2025 defensive data** (more accurate matchups)
- **Red zone opportunities heavily weighted** (strongest TD factor)
- **Established NFL players prioritized** over unproven rookies
- **Multi-factor scoring** (60% volume + 30% defense + 10% historical)

### Expected Performance Improvement:
The Combined Model focuses on **proven volume leaders** with **favorable defensive matchups**, which should significantly outperform the rookie-heavy traditional approach that went 2/10 in Week 4.

### Volume vs Rookie Boost Philosophy:
- **Traditional**: Bet on unproven rookies with "hot streaks"
- **Combined**: Bet on established players with guaranteed volume and weak defensive matchups

The Combined Model represents a **fundamental shift** from speculation to **data-driven volume analysis**.
